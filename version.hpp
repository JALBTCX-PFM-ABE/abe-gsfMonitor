/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! or / / ! are being used by Doxygen to
    document the software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.
    The lack of blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next
    block of dash preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the
    Doxygen formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>)
    that need to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! or / / ! and
    there is something that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen
    syntax.  Be very careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.

    Switched to using .ini file in $HOME (Linux) or $USERPROFILE (Windows) in the ABE.config directory.  Now

    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    07/23/14

    - Switched from using the old NV_INT64 and NV_U_INT32 type definitions to the C99 standard stdint.h and
      inttypes.h sized data types (e.g. int64_t and uint32_t).


    Version 1.16
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    02/16/15

    - To give better feedback to shelling programs in the case of errors I've added the program name to all
      output to stderr.


    Version 1.17
    Jan C. Depner (PFM Software)
    08/27/16

    - Now uses the same font as all other ABE GUI apps.  Font can only be changed in pfmView Preferences.
